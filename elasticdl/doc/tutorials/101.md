# 101 Tutorial

101 tutorial contains a series of documents which covers ElasticDL usage under different scenarios: local computer/private cluster/public cloud. It aims to help users get hands on quickly and have a preliminary understanding of ElasticDL.


## Overview


## ElasticDL in local

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day. Here we use Minikube to run ElasticDL in local laptop.

For details, please refer to [elasticdl_local](./elastic_local.md) document.
