# ElasticDL Client

This is the client command-line tool for ElasticDL. We can use it to build
Docker images for a distributed ElasticDL job and submit a train, evaluate
or predict job to a Kubernetes cluster.

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the
[tutorial](../docs/tutorials/get_started.md).
