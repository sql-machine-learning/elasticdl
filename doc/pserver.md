# Parameter Server Design


## Overview


## PServer


### Compoments


![pserver](./images/pserver.png)


PServer contains two main compoments:

- KVStore Servier
- Optimizer

1. The worker initializes a model, and push parameters to KVStore.
2. Before each step of training, the worker pulls the latest model from KVStore.
3. After forward/backward computation, the worker push gradients to KVStore. And KVStore will put the gradients to a Queue waiting for processing.
4. Optimizer gets a gradient from the Gradient Queue.
5. Then, Optimizer looks up the corresponding parameter from KVStore.
6. Optimizer applies gradients to parameters, and updates parameter back to KVStore.


The interfaces of KVStore Servicer could be like this:


```python
class KVStoreServicer(elasticdl_pb2_grpc.KVStoreServicer):
    def __init__(self):
        self.param_db = {}
        self.embedding_param_db = {}
        self.grad_queue = queue.Queue()

    def pull_param(self, request, _):
        pass

    def push_param(self, request, _):
        pass

    def push_gradient(self, request, _):
        pass

    def get_param(self):
        pass

    def set_param(self):
        pass

    def get_gradient(self):
        pass

    # embedding related interface is exposed explictly
    def pull_embedding_param(self, request, _):
        pass

    def push_embedding_param(self, request, _):
        pass

    def push_embedding_gradient(self, request, _):
        pass

    def get_embedding_param(self):
        pass

    def set_embedding_param(self):
        pass
```

### Parameter Transfromation


Parameters will be transformed into different data types in different stages.

Common parameter:

- worker forward/backward computation: TensorFlow Variable
- worker pushing parameter: serialized protobuf
- KVStore parameter DB: TensorFlow Variable
- optimizer: TensorFlow Variable


Embedding parameter:

- worker forward/backward computation: numpy ndarry based Python struct
- worker pushing parameter: serialized protobuf
- KVStore embedding parameter DB: numpy ndarry based Python struct
- optimizer: TensorFlow Variable



We have to define a `Tensor` proto message and a corresponding `Tensor` Python class to support all these tranformations.


The `Tensor` proto message could be like this:

```python

message Tensor {
    enum DataType {
        BOOL = 0;
        INT16 = 1;
        INT32 = 2;
        INT64 = 3;
        FP16 = 4;
        FP32 = 5;
        FP64 = 6;
    }
    string name = 1;
    DataType data_type = 2;
    repeated int64 dim = 3;
    bytes content = 4;
    repeated int64 indices = 5;
    int64 version = 6;
}

```

The `Tensor` Python class could be like this:

```
class Tensor(object):
    def __init__(self, name=None, value=None, indices=None, version=None):
        self.name = name
        self.value = value
        self.indices = indices
        self.version = version
```

There are also some helper functions:

```
def serialize_to_pb(tensor, pb):
    pass

def deserialize_from_pb(pb, tensor):
    pass

def convert_to_tf_variable(tensor):
    pass

def convert_to_tf_tensor(tensor):
    pass
```


### Gradient Queue

We decouple KVStore and Optimizer by a gradient queue to make the overall design clean. And the complexity is all handled at the gradient queue.

- Question 1, out-of-memory

Workers push gradients to the gradient queue of KVStore, pserver optimizer gets gradient from the queue, and does parameter optimization.

This is a classical producer-consumer problem. We have to ensure that the speed of optimizer processing gradients is large than the speed of workers pushing gradients. Otherwise, the gradient queue will become larger and larger and lead to out-of-memory.

We could set a limit size to the queue, if the condition is satisfied:

- just throwing away upcoming gradients from workers
- blocking `push_gradient` return from KVStore to workers


- Question 2, multi-threading optimizer

We could expose the optimizer numbers to users. If there is only one optimizer, the gradients will be handled one-by-one. So all gradients will be applied to parameters.

If there are multi-optimizers doing optimization, this will cause a race condition, and the order of reading/writing parameters will not be ensured.

The second choice is faster, but might loss some accuracy. Besides, we could also add a read-write-lock to avoid race condition.

- Question 3, async and sync update

In async mode, optimizer will get gradient from the queue immediately.

In sync mode, optimizer needs to wait for a certain number of gradients, and then get the gradient after addition.
