# Getting Started with ElasticDL

This tutorial contains a series of documents which covers ElasticDL usage under different scenarios: 

- local computer
- private cluster
- public cloud. 

It aims to help users get hands on quickly and have a preliminary understanding of ElasticDL.

## ElasticDL on local

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on users' laptop for who looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.

Here we use minikube to run ElasticDL in a local laptop. Please refer to [elasticdl_local](./elastic_local.md) for more details.


## ElasticDL on cluster

Here we will show how to run ElasticDL on a cluster.

Please refer to [elasticdl_cluster](elasticdl_cluster.md) for more details.


## ElasticDL on cloud

Here we will show how to run ElasticDL on Google cloud.

Please refer to [elasticdl_cloud](elasticdl_cloud.md) for more details.
