# Getting Started with ElasticDL

The tutorials in this document aims to help users get hands on quickly and have a preliminary understanding of ElasticDL.

## Run ElasticDL on Various Environments

The following tutorials demonstrates how to run ElasticDL on different environments: 

1. Local Environment
2. On-prem cluster
3. Public cloud

### ElasticDL on Local Environment

[Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/) is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally.
It runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on the laptop so developers can try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.

[This tutorial](elastic_local.md) uses Minikube to run ElasticDL on a local laptop.


### ElasticDL on On-prem Cluster

[This tutorial](elasticdl_on_prem_cluster.md) demonstrates how to run ElasticDL on an on-prem cluster.


### ElasticDL on Public Cloud

[This tutorial](elasticdl_cloud.md) shows how to run ElasticDL on a public cloud, namely, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

## Model Building

We have also provided [this tutorial](model_building.md) to illustrate how to define necessary components that will be
used for ElasticDL model training, evaluation, and prediction. 

## Data Preparation

[This tutorial](data_preparation.md) demonstrates how to prepare datasets into the right format that can be
used by ElasticDL.
