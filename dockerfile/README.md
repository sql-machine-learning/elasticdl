# Docker images

## Registry

We use AliCloud's docker registry to host docker images. Go to http://docker.alibaba-inc.com to register your account.

- Before you can use the registry in console, do `docker login --username=xxx reg.docker.alibaba-inc.com` to login to the registry.

## ElasticDL develop docker image

The image is intended to ease the developing process of ElasticDL. The docker file is in `devel` directory. The pre-built image's registry entry is `reg.docker.alibaba-inc.com/elasticdl/dev`.

- Use the image for developing: run the script `dev.sh` or `sudo dev.sh` if you are not part of the docker group. The script automatically determines your user id, group id from host machine, and propagate them to the docker container. This is to prevent the build process from creating artifacts under the root permission. The script also mounts your host home directory as the container home directory so you can build in the your git directories from there. Note that you might want to modify your `.bashrc` file to make it work on both host machine and in container.

- Build image: usually you don't need to build the image. Just use the one in the registry. But in case you need to modify the image to add more libraries, etc.
   ```bash
   docker build -t elasticdl/dev devel/Dockerfile
   docker tag elasticdl/dev  reg.docker.alibaba-inc.com/elasticdl/dev
   docker push reg.docker.alibaba-inc.com/elasticdl/dev
   ```
