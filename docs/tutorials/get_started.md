# Getting Started with ElasticDL

The tutorials in this document aims to help users get hands on quickly and have
a preliminary understanding of ElasticDL.

## Run ElasticDL on Various Environments

The following tutorials demonstrates how to run ElasticDL on different
environments:

1. Local Environment
2. On-prem cluster
3. Public cloud

### ElasticDL on Local Environment

[Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/) is a
tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally.  It runs a single-node
Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on the laptop so developers can
try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.

[This tutorial](elasticdl_local.md) uses Minikube to run ElasticDL on a local
laptop.

### ElasticDL on On-prem Cluster

[This tutorial](elasticdl_on_prem_cluster.md) demonstrates how to run ElasticDL
on an on-prem cluster.

### ElasticDL on Public Cloud

[This tutorial](elasticdl_cloud.md) shows how to run ElasticDL on a public
cloud, namely, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

## Model Building

We have also provided [this tutorial](model_contribution.md) to illustrate how to
define necessary components that will be used for ElasticDL model training,
evaluation, and prediction.
