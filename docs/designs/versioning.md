# Versioning

For better managing and releasing code, here is a summary about the versioning
story of ElasticDL. Some previous discussions can be found [here](#1121).

## Branches

There are three different type branches:

- **develop** branch: the main branch where the source code always reflects a
  state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
- **feature** branches: branch off from the `develop` branch and merge back into
  `develop`. `Feature` branches are used to develop new features, and
  created/maintained by developers themselves. `Feature` branches will be
  deleted after code changes get merge info `develop` branch.
- **release** branches: branch off from the `develop` branch. When the `develop`
  branch reaches the desired state of a new release, cut off a new release
  branch, and start to publish new versions there. Release branches will be
  kept.

For version numbers, we follow the Semantic Versioning
[2.0.0](https://semver.org) with style MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. 0.2.1). For each
MAJOR.MINOR, we keep a corresponding `release` branch (named `branch-x.y`), and
each following patch version x.y.z is released from it.

## Feature Development

New features and bugfixes are developed in `feature` branches. Make sure you
work with the latest version of `develop` branch.

```bash
# Start a new feature branch from develop branch

$ git checkout -b feature1 develop
# Do some code changes locally

$ git commit -a -m "Add some feature description"
$ git push origin feature1
# Create a PR for feature1 in https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/elasticdl

# Once the PR gets accepted and merged, it is ok to delete the branch locally

$ git checkout develop
$ git branch -D feature1
```

Here is the
[tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository)
on how to open a pull request.

## Releasing

Here are detailed steps for releasing an example version 0.1.0.

```bash
# Update RELEASE.md to include the new changes and get merged in develop branch

# Then, start a new release branch from develop branch

$ git checkout -b branch-0.1 develop
$ git push origin branch-0.1
# Prepare the first release candidate version v0.1.0rc0

$ ./scripts/bump_version.sh v0.1.0rc0
# Then commit changes

$ git commit -a -m "Release v0.1.0rc0"
$ git push origin branch-0.1
# Publish v0.1.0rc0 to PyPI

# A detailed instruction is available at https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/
```

So now we have v0.1.0rc0 ready to use. Test out this version. If any issues
found, get them fixed in `develop` branch, merged into `branch-0.1` branch, and
repeat the aforementioned steps to publish a new release candidate version. We
keep releasing `rc` version until no further issues found. At that time, release
the official `v0.1.0` version.

```bash
$ git checkout -b branch-0.1 develop
$ ./scripts/bump_version.sh v0.1.0
# Also remember to update RELEASE.md

$ git commit -a -m "Release v0.1.0"
$ git push origin branch-0.1
# Publish v0.1.0 to PyPI

# Also add a tag for this release

$ git tag v0.1.0 -a
$ git push origin v0.1.0
```

Note that for creating new releases and tags, you can also do from the
[website](https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/elasticdl/releases).

For cases where the `release` branch already exists (for example when releasing
0.1.1 and `branch-0.1` is already there), just reuse that `release` branch and
merge required commits from `develop` branch to the corresponding `release`
branch.
