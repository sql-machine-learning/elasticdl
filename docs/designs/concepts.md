# Concepts Design Doc

This document describes core concepts used in ElasticDL, and discusses their representations.

## Core Concepts

Fundamentally, machine learning is using algorithms to extract information from raw data and represent it in some type of model.

There are two kinds of parameters in a model, one is dense parameter, the other is sparse parameter. The sparse parameter is used by the embedding layer, so it is also called embedding table. The embedding table maps discrete ID *i* to embedding vector *váµ¢*.

Both dense parameter and embedding table includes a tensor data field, and some other auxiliary fields, like name. Embedding table has an extra auxiliary field called indices.

Tensor is used to represented a n-dim data. We support several data types, such as int8/int32/float32/float64.

Besides, we have two kinds of gradients, dense gradient and embedding table gradient. The components of dense gradient is the same with dense parameter, and the components of embedding table gradient is also the same with embedding table.

In ElasticDL, only a large embedding layer is represented by an embedding table. For small embedding layer, a dense parameter is used, but its gradient is sparse. It has indices, which is actually an embedding table gradient.

Let's make a short summary, following is all the core concepts used in ElasticDL:

- Model
- DenseParam
- EmbeddingTable
- Tensor

## In-Memory Representation

EmbeddingTable is initialized lazily in PS. Worker sends item ids to request embedding vectors from PS. If the ID is not found in PS, the corresponding embedding vector will be initialized and send back to the worker. For better query and increasing embedding vectors, we use a map data structure to represent EmbeddingTable.

```go
type TensorDtype = int64

const (
    Invalid TensorDtype = iota
    Int8 
    Int16
    Int32
    Int64
    Float16
    Float32
    Float64
    Bool
)

type Buffer struct {
    Data   []byte
    Length int64
    Dtype  TensorDtype
}

type Tensor struct {
    Content *Buffer
    Dims    []int64
    Indices []int64
}

type DenseParam struct {
    Name   string
    Tensor Tensor
}

type Emdedding = Buffer // alias for better understanding

type EmbeddingTable struct {
    Name       string
    Embeddings map[string]*Emdedding
    Dtype      TensorDtype
}

type Model struct {
    Initialized     bool
    Version         int32
    Dtype           TensorDtype
    DenseParams     map[string]*DenseParam
    EmbeddingTables map[string]*EmbeddingTable
}
```


## Message Representation

```proto
enum TensorDtype {
  // Not a legal value for DataType. Used to indicate a DataType field
  // has not been set.
  DT_INVALID = 0;

  DT_INT8 = 1;
  DT_INT16 = 2;
  DT_INT32 = 3;
  DT_INT64 = 4;
  DT_FLOAT16 = 5;
  DT_FLOAT32 = 6;
  DT_FLOAT64 = 7;
  DT_BOOL = 8;
}

message Tensor {
  repeated int64 dims = 1;
  bytes content = 2;
  TensorDtype dtype = 3;
}

message DenseParam {
  string name = 1;
  Tensor tensor = 2;
}

message EmbeddingTable {
  string name = 1;
  Tensor tensor = 2;
  repeated int64 indices = 3;
}

message Model {
  bool initialized = 1;
  int32 version = 2;
  repeated DenseParam dense_params = 3;
  repeated EmbeddingTable embedding_tables = 4;
}
```

## RPC Service

Following is some auxiliary messages needed by RPC services.

```proto
message PullDenseParamsRequest {
  int32 version = 1;
}

message PullDenseParamsResponse {
  bool initialized = 1;
  repeated DenseParam dense_params = 2;
}

message PullEmbeddingTableRequest {
  string name = 1;
  repeated int64 indices = 2;
}

message EmbeddingTableInfo {
  string name = 1;
  int64 dim = 2;
  string initializer = 3;
}

message PushGradientResponse {
  bool accepted = 1;
  int32 version = 2;
}
```

Following is RPC services between PS and worker.

```proto
service Pserver {
  rpc pull_dense_params(PullDenseParamsRequest) returns (PullDenseParamsResponse);
  rpc pull_embedding_table(PullEmbeddingTableRequest) returns (EmbeddingTable);
  rpc push_dense_params(Model) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
  rpc push_embedding_table_infos(EmbeddingTableInfo) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
  rpc push_gradient(Model) returns (PushGradientResponse);
}
```
